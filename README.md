## Description

This project is a weather forecast web application that allows users to enter the name of a city to get real-time weather information. The application displays temperature, humidity, and wind speed, along with dynamic weather icons that change based on current conditions.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features

- City name input to retrieve weather forecast
- Displays temperature, humidity, and wind speed
- Dynamic weather icons based on current conditions
- Responsive and modern design

## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I faced challenges integrating with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. Practicing how to consume RESTful APIs and handle returned data was very valuable. I also implemented user-friendly error messages to enhance the user experience and ensured the application is responsive across different screen sizes.
